Project Overview
================

A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery
method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service
five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a
week. Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory
results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers.
Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the
delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries, losing
the distributor more money than what was being saved. Weâ€™ve been hired
by the wholesale distributor to find what types of customers they have,
to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the
future. Our task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if
any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment
customers into distinct categories.
